# Actor Class Documentation

## Overview

The `Actor` class is a derived class that represents an 
actor in a theatrical context (abstraction). 
It extends the `Person` class,
inheriting its properties and methods, 
while adding additional attributes relevant to an actor,
including their costume and role.
